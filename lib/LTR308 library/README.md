LTR308 Arduino Library
========================================
This is a Arduino Library for the Lite-On LTR308 optical sensor.
This illumination sensor has a flat response across most of the visible spectrum and has an adjustable integration time. 
It communicates via I2C and runs at 3.3V. 

Based on the (incompatible) LTR303 driver written by lovelesh @ https://github.com/automote/LTR303
